If you have been reading the news lately (who reads the news??), then you would know about a new competitor to Nodejs that allows you write server-side JavaScript!

Well, that new thing that I am talking about is called Deno! It is so new and it was created by the same person who created Node.js! So, that means this new runtime for JavaScript should have something very good. 

## Installation
You can head over to https://deno.land/ or you could copy and paste one of the following commands into your command line or terminal and get started! 

**Using Shell:**
```
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
```

**Or using PowerShell:**

```
iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

**Using Homebrew (macOS or Linux):**

```
brew install deno
```

**Using Chocolatey (Windows):**
```
choco install deno
```

## Usage
Alright, now that Deno is installed, lets do something *usefull* with it. So, open your terminal, and type:

```
deno
> console.log(window);
```

And you should get bunch of lines of code, that you will soon understand.

The first thing you will notice is, `window`, what is that doing here? 

Well, we are going to figure that out. 

In the meantime, you can check out the other posts on my blog!
