*All this time, we have been wasting our time writing CSS for our websites.*

## Admit It
Now, let's admit it. CSS is completely useless for our daily lives. There is no purpose in writing CSS. All it does that it makes our site look more uglier than before. 

## The Solution
That is why NSSX was created. It's a styling language that is simple and makes your website look how it's suppose to be. Here is a quick demo of it:

```html
<html>
<head>
  <script type="NSSX" href="./main.nssx" />
</head>
<body>
  <h2>Simple Header</h2>
</body>
</html>
```

Now, here is a NSSX file written as simple as possible.

```css
h2 { more-ugly: true }
more-ugly { font-size: ':(', font-weight: ":)" }
```

As, you notice, we specify the font size as a sad face, meaning it will choose the size that it doesn't like. Then the happy face means it will choose a font-weight that it likes. 

## Features
In this section, I will speed through the features as they are not that important. 

- No Need to Write Numbers. Welcome to Keyboard Based Emoji's
- Get rid of standard CSS, you can create your own properties in your own time if you want.
- Reads your mind

## Reads Your Mind?
Let me take a foot back for a second. 

If you connect your brain via a USB cable to your computer, (oh wait. Laptops abandoned USB. Oh well.) Then it will read your brain and design the site for you. Just use the following code:

```css
* { connect-brain: true; use-brain: true }
```

And with just that, whatever you imagined comes true! 

**NOTICE:** What you just read was just presented for comedy reasons to get a good laugh since we all need this one time where we can get tricked or even laugh. 

NSSX is not REAL, however, I might make it come true in a more respectful manner than what has been presented. 

Have a Great Day! :)
