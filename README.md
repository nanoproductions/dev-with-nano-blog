Welcome to the official Github Repo for Nano's Blog, Dev with Nano.

## Notifications

If you are interested in being in the know for when I release my new posts, just follow this repo and whenever there is a commit or pull request merge, you should then know a new post is around the corner.

## Github Actions

When a commit or pull request merge is made, Github Actions builds the site into a static site and deploy it to Netlify.

## Contribution

I am currently not accepting any contributions for blog posts, but to the design or functionality, I will think about. Discuss it in the issues before writing any code to avoid any issues later.

## Code Style

I will have an official code style guide released soon which will follow the coming soon `Nano Code Style`. Any way, if you do contribute, just follow the way I have written the code and you should be fine.

Here are some basic tips:

- Use the React Context API
- Use SCSS theme folder for styles, instead of SCSS modules

## Feature Requests

I know that my blog is not as robust as it may seem, but I do enjoy taking feature requests and seeing the open mind of the community, but I will not be able to add every request as I have to look at the goal of this blog and how it can be taken.
