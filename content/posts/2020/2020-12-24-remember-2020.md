Happy Holidays from Nano! 

Let's take these last few days before the end of the year to reflect upon the year. 

2020 started off with a blast with the ongoing pandemic and furious decisions having to be made. Towards March, we saw the closing of many stores, many people having no source of making money as their work had closed down.

And during this unfortunate times, technology kept the world going. From Video Meetings via Zoom, or the entertainment to keep the days going. 

## Transition of Nano's Blog
At the beginning of 2020, we saw a great transition to this blog from the old Wordpress one. The first post this blog started from was the goodbye of 2019, and here we are in the goodbye stages of 2020. 

## Transition of the World
The world saw a great impact in 2020. With the ending of 2019, we started to only hear about the virus spreading in China, but not to know it would make it this far over the sea. 

We saw the turn of the decade result in what we are seeing today. Also, the increase in demand of sanitary supplies, like Tissue Paper, hand sanitizers and many household grocery items. People were furious and scared of a lockdown, but we were misguided by the people.

## Traversy Media
In 2020 we saw Traversy Media taking a break from YouTube for his health issues, but never the less, he stayed strong and hopeful, and we gladly saw his return very quickly.

## The Return.
We saw the return of `thenewboston`, after many years a return had come. It was a random return but brought many smiles to many faces. 

## Overload of Entertainment
With the global pandemic, we need a driving force that will ensure that everyone is entertained at home, well that resulted in the outcome of increased entertainment.

## Deno
We saw the popularity and roar for Deno, a JavaScript runtime built on Rust. With people conflicting over the replacement of Node, which slowly declined and now is silent. 

## This Blog...
In January, two posts which were brought over from the old platform were released.

In Feburary, it was a total month of silence. No new posts were released.

In March, NanRadio, a playlist of incredible songs on YouTube that I think were great made its rise and saw a post. 

For April Fools, I decide to take a turn and have some laughs, because, why not? 

In May, I worked on a large blog post that was basically a re-written version of one of my popular YouTube videos, a Flask Calculator, still having the touch of Nano on it. 

This blog saw a rise in June and July with almost 7 posts on TypeScript coming out, at almost the daily rate! 

In August, the blog remained high with 8 posts coming out! 

Glib came out around August, and we saw two posts made specifically for it. An incredible project saw its life! 

And... a debugging practice, and understanding `HTTP`, which took very long to write, but had some incredible content. 

And then we see Vue 3! It was released, and a post dedicated to it in September. Also, a local storage library by Nano was created with a post on that as well! 

Then we see the decline of only one post in October and silence in November. 

Finally, almost December ending and you are reading this. 

## 2021...
Well, with the current conditions and news, I believe that 2021 won't be much different than 2020. 

However, we can change that with three simple public rules:

1. Wear a Mask
2. Stay 6 Feet apart 
3. Stay home if you are sick

Simple. 

In terms of my blog, I hope next year won't be as slence and some great content to come out. I want to shower this blog in content and in knowledge. This blog will be a sponge that has been over squeezed beyond its limit. 

## Ummm. New Years Resolutions
I suggest creating a New Years resolutions. Your list should include at least 3 things you want to improve on next year. 

### Bad Habit
If you are planning on breaking a habit, creating a table and track your habbit and how often it is being done. 

Two tips for breaking a habbit:
1. Punish yourself for doing the bad habbit.
2. Reward yourself for every 10-20 days you don't do the habbit. Eventually it will fade away. 

## Challenges 
*This is kind of like an extension of your New Year resolutions.*
 Why not challenge yourself next year? Here are some great goals to set.
- Learn a new language (Ex: Spanish, French, Arabic...)
- Find a book you would enjoy and read it! Aim for 10 books next year.
- Get rid of songs of past year and shape yourself with better songs that will in the end make you a better person. 

Some of the challenges I am taking on are:
- Learning Arabic! 
- Writing on this blog at least once a week! 


## My Comedy Book!
I am currently writing my comedy book, still. But have a plan to release it in 2021, hopefully before summer! 

## Conclusion
And that is it! I hope you have a great rest of the year and a great holiday seasons. Have some fun. Set some challenges and enjoy! 

Maybe 2021 might be the year you change yourself and make yourself a better person!
